# ndclondon2021
This repo contains a PDF file of the slides I presented at NDC London on the 28th of January 2021.

You can download the .SQL file to create the Microsoft sample Northwind database from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs).

I will update this file to a link to the YouTube video once published by the find folks at NDC.
